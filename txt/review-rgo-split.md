# Review: R-Go Split ergonomic keyboard

## TLDR

I used the `R-Go Split` for roughly 3 years, until the micro-usb port broke for
good.

Overall, I can recommend it as a good and cost-effective (at least in the space
of split/ergonomic keyboards) keyboard for those who want to dip their toe into
the space of ergonmic hardware without investing too much, be it regading
money or learning aspect.

## How It Began

Ever since RSI became a part of my life, i optimized my posture during work.
This involved acquiring my first split keyboard.

After skimming the market i settled for
`R-Go Split` by r-go-tools
with UK layout.

### Pros

#### Magnetic Mount Of Both Halves

Parts can be joined via magnets to optionally use it in non-split way if
necessary.

#### Slim Design

10mm height in total (top of keycap to rubber feet).

low profile case, key travel is low.

#### Easy To Learn

due to:

* traditional horizontal staggered layout
* tenkeyless. enough keys covering 98% of use-case

#### Cost-Effective

relatively low cost.

currently about 120$, which is low end of ergo keeb spectrum. I don't think
there are split keyboards cheaper than this.

### Cons

#### Weak Micro-USB port

During 3y i unplugged the keyboard's usb cables nearly every day, which makes
roughly 1000 unplug cycles per usb connector.
It started to get flakey after about 2y.

Case is not screw mounted (I assume it's glued, but i didn't check in detail).

#### Some Keys Are Weird

`pgUp`/`pgDown` by default are on `fn`-layer and thus very awkward to reach
(or example, page-scrolling in terminal `Shift` + `FN` + `3` are all left-hand
keys)
This made me invent [^caps-layer-0] [^caps-layer-1] a tap-hold navigation layer
on the CAPS key (tap=Esc, hold=arrows on right-hand's home-row), which is very
convenient and proved very effective until today, even on traditional keyboards.
I didn't know the term "tap-hold" back then though.

### Undecided

#### Rubber Dome Switches

Rubber-dome switches were not an issue for me back then, and if you dislike
them it's still two-fold as they contribute to the low profile, yet come with
their mediocre key press characteristic.
