<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<p>I used the <code>R-Go Split</code> for roughly 3 years, until the micro-usb port broke for
good.</p>
<p>Overall, I can recommend it as a good and cost-effective (at least in the space
of spit&#47;ergonomic keyboards) keyboard for those who want to dip their toe into
the space of ergonmic hardware without investing too much, be it regading
money or learning aspect.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-began">How It Began</h2>
<p>Ever since RSI became a part of my life, i optimized my posture during work.
This involved acquiring my first split keyboard.</p>
<p>After skimming the market i settled for
<code>R-Go Split</code> by r-go-tools
with UK layout.</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<h4 id="magnetic-mount-of-both-halves">Magnetic Mount Of Both Halves</h4>
<p>Parts can be joined via magnets to optionally use it in non-split way if
necessary.</p>
<h4 id="slim-design">Slim Design</h4>
<p>10mm height in total (top of keycap to rubber feet).</p>
<p>low profile case, key travel is low.</p>
<h4 id="easy-to-learn">Easy To Learn</h4>
<p>due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>traditional horizontal staggered layout</li>
<li>tenkeyless. enough keys covering 98% of use-case</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cost-effective">Cost-Effective</h4>
<p>relatively low cost.</p>
<p>currently about 120$, which is low end of ergo keeb spectrum. I don&#8217;t think
there are split keyboards cheaper than this.</p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<h4 id="weak-micro-usb-port">Weak Micro-USB port</h4>
<p>During 3y i unplugged the keyboard&#8217;s usb cables nearly every day, which makes
roughly 1000 unplug cycles per usb connector.
It started to get flakey after about 2y.</p>
<p>Case is not screw mounted (I assume it&#8217;s glued, but i didn&#8217;t check in detail).</p>
<h4 id="some-keys-are-weird">Some Keys Are Weird</h4>
<p><code>pgUp</code>&#47;<code>pgDown</code> by default are on <code>fn</code>-layer and thus very awkward to reach
(or example, page-scrolling in terminal <code>Shift</code> + <code>FN</code> + <code>3</code> are all left-hand
keys)
This made me invent <sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> a tap-hold navigation layer
on the CAPS key (tap=Esc, hold=arrows on right-hand&#8217;s home-row), which is very
convenient and proved very effective until today, even on traditional keyboards.
I didn&#8217;t know the term &#8220;tap-hold&#8221; back then though.</p>
<h3 id="undecided">Undecided</h3>
<h4 id="rubber-dome-switches">Rubber Dome Switches</h4>
<p>Rubber-dome switches were not an issue for me back then, and if you dislike
them it&#8217;s still two-fold as they contribute to the low profile, yet come with
their mediocre key press characteristic.</p>
